## Use Icon Fonts in Sketch

This plugin helps you easily insert and manage icons from icon fonts - such as FontAwesome, Ion or Material Design Icons - in your Sketch designs.

##### Use any icon font.
The plugin itself has no font built-in. You will need to download and install the fonts you wish to use directly from the font publisher. The most popular ones, however, have been put into a bundle which you can easily download from here: https://github.com/keremciu/font-bundles

### - Features
###### Why you need to use it

> `For The Designer:` 
> When a designer wants to add an icon from an icon font - such as material design, fontawesome, etc. - they usually need to find a cheatsheet containing all the font's icons, and then manually copy+paste each one they wish to use into their design - or use a third-party application. Time consuming and cumbersome.

- You can now easily view and add any icon directly Sketch!

> `For The Developer:` 
> When a developer wants to find out the name of an icon that was used by the Designer, they need to search through a lengthy list of icons, until they find it. Time consuming and cumbersome.

- You can now easily find out an icon's name directly in Sketch, without needing to perform a search!
